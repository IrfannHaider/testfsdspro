        "**Purpose:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Constructors:**\n",
        "    - Used for initializing objects when they are created.\n",
        "    - Ensure objects start in a valid and consistent state.\n",
        "- **Regular methods:**\n",
        "    - Perform specific actions or calculations on objects.\n",
        "    - Define the behavior of objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Name:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Constructors:**\n",
        "    - Always named `__init__` (two underscores before and after).\n",
        "- **Regular methods:**\n",
        "    - Can have any meaningful name, following Python naming conventions.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Execution:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Constructors:**\n",
        "    - Automatically called when an object is instantiated using the class name.\n",
        "- **Regular methods:**\n",
        "    - Must be explicitly called on an existing object instance.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Return type:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Constructors:**\n",
        "    - Do not have an explicit return type (implicitly return `None`).\n",
        "- **Regular methods:**\n",
        "    - Can have any return type, including `None`.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Arguments:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Constructors:**\n",
        "    - Implicitly take `self` as the first argument, referring to the newly created object.\n",
        "    - Can take additional arguments to provide initial values for object attributes.\n",
        "- **Regular methods:**\n",
        "    - Also take `self` as the first argument, but can have any number of additional arguments as needed.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example:**\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class Person:\n",
        "    def __init__(self, name, age):  # Constructor\n",

        "        self.age = age\n",

        "    def greet(self):  # Regular method\n",

        "person1.greet()  # Regular method called explicitly\n",

        "\n",

        "    - `self` is used to create and assign values to instance variables, which are attributes that belong to each individual object of the class.\n",
        "    - These variables store the object's specific data and differentiate it from other instances of the same class.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",

        "\n",
        "1. When a `Person` object is created (e.g., `person1 = Person(\"Alice\", 30)`), the constructor `__init__` is automatically called.\n",
        "2. The `self` parameter implicitly receives a reference to the newly created `person1` object.\n",
        "3. Inside the constructor, `self.name = name` creates an instance variable named `name` and assigns the value \"Alice\" to it, specifically for `person1`.\n",
        "4. Similarly, `self.age = age` creates an instance variable named `age` and assigns the value 30 to it for `person1`.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Points:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- Without `self`, you couldn't create instance variables that are unique to each object.\n",
        "- `self` is crucial for object-oriented programming, allowing methods to access and modify object-specific data.\n",
        "- It's a convention, not a keyword, but it's strongly recommended to use `self` for clarity and consistency."

        "\n",
        "Inheritance in Python:\n",
        "\n",
        "It is a mechanism that allows you to create new classes (called subclasses or child classes) that inherit attributes and methods from existing classes (called parent classes or base classes).\n",
        "The subclass inherits all the features of the parent class, while also having the ability to add its own unique attributes and methods, or modify inherited ones.\n",
        "\n",
        "class SubClass(ParentClass):\n",
        "    # SubClass-specific attributes and methods\n",
        "Key Significance in OOP:\n",
        "\n",
        "Code Reusability:\n",
        "\n",
        "Inheritance promotes code reuse by allowing you to create new classes that build upon existing functionality, preventing redundant code.\n",
        "You can create a base class with common attributes and methods, and then create specialized subclasses that inherit those features, adding their own unique characteristics.\n",
        "Hierarchical Modeling:\n",
        "\n",
        "Inheritance enables you to model real-world relationships between objects accurately.\n",
        "For example, you can create a Vehicle class with attributes like wheels and a move() method, and then create subclasses like Car, Truck, and Bike that inherit these features while adding their own specific attributes and behaviors.\n",
        "Polymorphism:\n",
        "\n",
        "Inheritance facilitates polymorphism, which means objects of different classes can be treated as if they were of the same type, as long as they share a common interface.\n",
        "This allows for flexible and adaptable code that can work with different types of objects without requiring explicit knowledge of their exact class.\n",
        "Additional Benefits:\n",
        "\n",
        "Modularity: Breaking down code into smaller, more manageable classes through inheritance improves code organization and maintainability.\n",
        "Extensibility: Adding new features or modifying existing behavior becomes easier by extending existing classes through inheritance.\n",

        "\n",
        "Encapsulation in object-oriented programming (OOP) refers to bundling data (attributes) and methods (operations) together into a single unit like a class, hiding the internal implementation details while providing a controlled interface for external interaction. This concept rests on two important pillars: access control and data hiding.\n",
        "\n",
        "**1. Access Control:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* This principle regulates how external entities can access an object's internal data and functionality. By controlling access, we can:\n",
        "    * **Protect data integrity:** By preventing direct manipulation of internal data, we ensure it remains consistent and valid, as only defined methods can modify it.\n",
        "    * **Enhance modularity:** Different parts of the program can only interact with an object through its public interface, simplifying the overall program structure and reducing dependencies.\n",
        "    * **Improve security:** Sensitive data can be hidden from unauthorized access, providing an extra layer of protection.\n",
        "\n",
        "Access control is implemented through:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Visibility Modifiers:** These keywords like `public`, `private`, and `protected` define which methods and attributes within a class are accessible from outside. Public methods and attributes are accessible to anyone, while private ones are only accessible within the class itself. Protected elements are accessible within the class and its subclasses.\n",
        "* **Getter and Setter Methods:** These methods provide controlled access to private attributes. The getter method allows reading the attribute value, while the setter method allows modifying it while potentially performing validation or other checks.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. Data Hiding:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* This principle focuses on keeping an object's internal representation hidden from unauthorized parties. By hiding data, we can:\n",
        "    * **Simplify implementation:** The internal workings of an object are abstracted away, making it easier to understand and manage its public interface.\n",
        "    * **Increase flexibility:** Changes to the internal implementation can be made without affecting external users, as long as the public interface remains the same. This promotes code maintainability and reusability.\n",
        "    * **Reduce coupling:** Data hiding minimizes dependencies between objects, as they primarily interact through publicly exposed methods rather than directly accessing each other's internal data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Data hiding is achieved through:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Private attributes:** These attributes are only accessible within the class and cannot be directly accessed from outside.\n",
        "* **Internal methods:** These methods handle manipulating the private data and are also only accessible within the class.\n",
        "* **Abstraction:** The public interface of an object serves as an abstraction, exposing only essential details and functionalities while hiding the underlying implementation complexity.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Benefits of Encapsulation:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Improved code quality:** Encapsulation leads to more modular, maintainable, and secure code.\n",
        "* **Reduced errors:** Controlled access protects data integrity and reduces the risk of accidental or malicious data manipulation.\n",
        "* **Increased flexibility:** Encapsulation allows for easier change and evolution of the internal implementation without breaking external dependencies.\n",
        "* **Enhanced collaboration:** Different developers can work on different parts of the codebase more effectively by relying on defined interfaces rather than manipulating internal details.\n",

By having private fields and exposing them through methods or properties, you immediately gain some advantages, such as access control granularity, possibility to validate input prior to storing the value, and possibility to add logging or other auditing mechanisms2. When calling code wants to retrieve a value, it should not depend on from where the value comes. Internally, the class can store the value in a field or retrieve it from some external resource (such as a file or a database). Perhaps the value is not stored at all, but calculated on-the-fly. This should not matter to the calling code.

        "Enhanced Reusability: Encapsulation allows classes to be reused in different contexts without requiring changes to external code, as long as the public interface remains consistent.\n",

        "Complexity: Overuse of encapsulation, especially when applied excessively to simple classes, can lead to overly complex code. This complexity might make the code harder to read and understand for others.\n",
        "\n",
        "Increased Code Volume: Implementing encapsulation with getters and setters can increase the volume of code in a class, especially in scenarios where many attributes require such methods. This could lead to larger codebases and more maintenance overhead.\n",
        "\n",
        "Performance Impact: The use of getter and setter methods, compared to direct attribute access, may introduce a slight performance overhead due to method invocation. However, in most cases, this impact is negligible.\n",
        "\n",
        "Encouraging Direct Attribute Access: Python doesn't strictly enforce encapsulation, as it allows accessing private attributes using name mangling or unconventional practices. This might lead developers to access private attributes directly, undermining the intended encapsulation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Over-restriction: Over-encapsulation or excessively hiding attributes/methods might limit the flexibility of classes, making it harder to extend or modify their behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "Maintenance Challenges: Modifying the internal structure of a class that heavily utilizes encapsulation might require changes across multiple methods or classes that rely on the encapsulated structure. This could potentially lead to maintenance challenges.\n",
        "\n",
        "Debugging Complexity: Encapsulation might obscure the internal state of an object, making it harder to debug issues related to private attributes as their visibility is restricted.\n",
        "\n",
        "Despite these potential drawbacks, encapsulation remains a fundamental principle in object-oriented programming. Balancing the use of encapsulation with other design principles and considering the specific needs of the project can help mitigate these drawbacks and ensure effective use of encapsulation in Python."

        "\n",
        "Encapsulation is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that involves bundling data (attributes) and the code that operates on that data (methods) together within a single unit, known as a class. This bundling promotes code reusability and modularity in several ways:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Reusability:\n",
        "\n",
        "Self-contained modules: Classes act as independent, reusable modules that encapsulate specific functionality. You can create multiple instances of a class to represent different objects with the same behavior, using them in different parts of your program or even across different projects.\n",
        "Abstraction: Encapsulation hides the internal implementation details of a class, exposing only a public interface (methods and properties). This allows you to reuse classes without needing to understand their inner workings, making them more versatile and adaptable to different contexts.\n",
        "2. Modularity:\n",
        "\n",
        "Breaking down complexity: By dividing a program into smaller, self-contained classes, encapsulation makes complex systems more manageable. Each class can be developed and tested independently, reducing code coupling and improving overall organization.\n",
        "Loose coupling: Classes can interact with each other through well-defined interfaces, minimizing dependencies and making code more flexible. Changes to one class are less likely to impact others, enhancing maintainability and reducing the risk of errors.\n",
        "Python-specific features for encapsulation:\n",
        "\n",
        "Private and protected members: Python allows you to control access to class members using underscores (_ and __ prefixes). This helps protect sensitive data and enforce encapsulation principles.\n",
        "Properties: Python's @property decorator provides a way to create methods that behave like attributes, promoting cleaner interfaces and better encapsulation of data access and modification.\n",

        "Information hiding, a key aspect of encapsulation, is the practice of restricting direct access to an object's internal data and operations. It involves creating a **boundary** between the internal implementation details and the public interface that other parts of the program can interact with.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Why is information hiding essential in software development?**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Increased Modularity:** Information hiding helps break down complex programs into smaller, self-contained modules or classes. Each module encapsulates its own data and functionality, reducing dependencies and making the code easier to understand, maintain, and modify.\n",

        "2. **Improved Code Reusability:** Well-encapsulated modules can be reused in different parts of a program or even across different projects without needing to worry about the internal implementation details. This promotes code efficiency and saves development time.\n",

        "3. **Enhanced Code Stability:** By shielding internal data and operations from unauthorized access, information hiding protects the core functionality from accidental or malicious modifications. This results in more stable and reliable programs.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Simplified Maintenance and Debugging:** When changes need to be made, information hiding ensures that modifications are localized within the specific module, reducing the impact on other parts of the program and simplifying debugging efforts.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Enhanced Abstraction:** Information hiding enables developers to create clear and concise interfaces for public access, hiding the complexity of internal operations. This abstraction improves program readability and makes it easier for other developers to understand and use the code.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Improved Security:** Restricting access to sensitive data can enhance security by preventing unauthorized users or system components from accessing or modifying it. This is crucial for applications handling confidential information.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Examples of information hiding in practice:**\n",

        "**Code Reusability:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Common Interface:** Polymorphism allows you to create a common interface (like the `Shape` class in the example) that can be used to interact with different objects, even if they have distinct implementations. This reduces code duplication and promotes code sharing.\n",
        "- **General-Purpose Functions:** You can write functions that work with objects of various types, as long as they share a common interface. This makes code more adaptable and reusable in different contexts.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Flexibility:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Extensibility:** New subclasses can be easily added to an existing code base without modifying the functions that use the base class. This makes code more adaptable to future changes and extensions.\n",
        "- **Loose Coupling:** Polymorphism promotes loose coupling between components, as they interact through abstract interfaces rather than concrete implementations. This makes code more modular and easier to maintain.\n",
        "- **Adaptable Behavior:** Polymorphism allows for dynamic behavior based on the specific object type at runtime. This enables code to adapt to different scenarios and requirements without manual intervention.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Specific Examples from the Code:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Area Calculation:** The `area()` method in the `Shape` class is polymorphic, allowing different shapes to provide their own implementation for calculating area. This makes the code reusable for various shapes without redundant code.\n",
        "- **New Shape Addition:** You could easily introduce a new shape, like a `Square`, by defining a subclass of `Shape` and implementing its `area()` method. The existing code that uses the `Shape` interface would automatically work with the new shape without modifications.\n",
        "\n",
        "**In summary, polymorphism is a powerful tool in Python that leads to more concise, adaptable, and maintainable code. It's a cornerstone of object-oriented programming that fosters code reusability and flexibility, making it an essential concept for building well-structured and scalable applications.**"

        "Abstraction is a fundamental concept of object-oriented programming that enables programmers to hide complex implementation details while just showing users the most crucial data and functions. In Python, data abstraction is used to hide irrelevant details from the user and show only the details that are relevant to the users . For example, a car has an accelerator, clutch, and brake, and we all know that pressing an accelerator will increase the speed of the car and applying the brake can stop the car, but we don’t know the internal mechanism of the car and how these functionalities can work. This detail hiding is known as data abstraction.\n",

        "In Python, data abstraction can be achieved by using abstract classes and abstract classes can be created using the `abc` (abstract base class) module and `abstractmethod` of the `abc` module . Abstract class is a class in which one or more abstract methods are defined. When a method is declared inside the class without its implementation, it is known as an abstract method . Abstract methods of the base class force its child class to write the implementation of all abstract methods defined in the base class. If we do not implement the abstract methods of the base class in the child class, then our code will give an error\n",

        "\n",
        "Abstraction is a powerful tool in large-scale software development projects, offering numerous benefits for developers and the overall project structure. Here are some key advantages:\n",
        "\n",
        "**1. Increased Modularity and Maintainability:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* By hiding complex implementation details behind well-defined interfaces, abstraction allows developers to focus on specific modules without worrying about the intricate workings of other parts. This modularity simplifies code understanding, maintenance, and updates.\n",
        "* Changes in one module can be made without affecting others, as long as the interface remains consistent. This increases overall project maintainability and reduces the risk of introducing cascading bugs.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. Improved Code Reusability:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* Abstract classes and interfaces can be designed to capture common functionalities across different parts of the system. This allows developers to reuse existing code components instead of writing the same logic repeatedly, saving time and effort.\n",
        "* By focusing on behavior instead of specific implementations, abstraction enables code to be reused across different contexts and platforms, further enhancing efficiency.\n",
        "\n",
        "**3. Enhanced Developer Productivity:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* Abstraction simplifies the development process by reducing cognitive load. Developers don't need to delve into low-level details, allowing them to think at a higher level and focus on the essential logic of their tasks.\n",
        "* This makes development faster and more efficient, especially in large teams where multiple developers are working on different parts of the project.\n",
        "\n",
        "**4. Improved Scalability and Flexibility:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* Abstract interfaces allow for changes in underlying implementations without affecting other parts of the system. This makes the software more flexible and adaptable to future changes in requirements or technologies.\n",
        "* As new technologies emerge, developers can easily swap out specific implementations while maintaining compatibility with the overall system thanks to the well-defined interfaces provided by abstraction.\n",
        "\n",
        "**5. Enhanced Communication and Collaboration:**\n",
        "\n",

        "Abstraction enhances code reusability and modularity in Python programs by facilitating the creation of components with well-defined interfaces that can be easily reused and integrated across different parts of the codebase. Here's how abstraction contributes to these aspects:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Code Reusability:\n",
        "Componentization: Abstraction allows developers to encapsulate common functionalities or patterns into reusable components or modules.\n",
        "Reuse of Interfaces: Abstracting common functionalities into well-defined interfaces allows different parts of the codebase to interact with these functionalities without concerning themselves with the underlying implementation details.\n",
        "Promotes DRY Principle: The \"Don't Repeat Yourself\" (DRY) principle is encouraged as developers can reuse abstracted components instead of duplicating code.\n",
        "2. Modularity:\n",
        "Clear Interfaces: Abstraction provides clear and well-defined interfaces for modules or components, hiding complex implementations behind these interfaces.\n",
        "Independent Modules: Abstracted components are designed to function independently. They can be easily swapped or replaced without affecting the rest of the system, promoting modularity.\n",
        "Separation of Concerns: Abstracting functionalities into separate modules or layers allows for a clearer separation of concerns, making the codebase easier to understand and maintain.\n",
        "3. Encapsulation and Information Hiding:\n",
        "Encapsulation: Abstraction facilitates encapsulation by exposing only necessary details and hiding the internal complexities of implementations. This protects components from unintended interference and reduces dependencies.\n",
        "Reduced Dependencies: Well-abstracted components reduce dependencies between different parts of the system, promoting loose coupling and enhancing modularity.\n",
        "4. Flexibility and Adaptability:\n",
        "Easier Modifications: Abstracted components can be modified or updated without impacting other parts of the system. This flexibility allows for easier adaptations to changes in requirements or technology.\n",
        "5. Testing and Debugging:\n",
        "Isolated Testing: Abstracted components can be tested independently, ensuring that they function correctly before integration, thus simplifying testing and debugging processes.\n",
        "Debugging Simplification: Abstraction isolates bugs or issues to specific components, making the debugging process more manageable.\n",
        "6. Collaboration and Teamwork:\n",
        "Shared Understanding: Abstraction provides a shared understanding of interfaces and functionalities, facilitating collaboration among team members working on different parts of the system.\n",
        "In Python, abstraction is often achieved using abstract classes, interfaces, or defining well-structured APIs. By abstracting common functionalities into reusable and independent components, code becomes more modular, easier to maintain, and highly reusable, enabling efficient development and enhancement of software systems."

        "\n",
        " **Here are the key benefits of using composition over inheritance in Python, particularly in terms of code flexibility and reusability:**\n",
        "\n",
        "**1. Loose Coupling:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- Composition promotes **loose coupling** between classes, meaning they are more independent and less tangled.\n",
        "- Changes to one class are less likely to affect other classes, making the code more maintainable and adaptable.\n",
        "- Inheritance, on the other hand, can create tight coupling between parent and child classes, making changes more difficult and potentially creating ripple effects.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. Runtime Flexibility:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- Composition allows you to **change the behavior of an object at runtime** by swapping out its component objects.\n",
        "- This can be very useful for configuration, testing, or adapting to different scenarios.\n",
        "- Inheritance, in contrast, typically fixes the behavior at compile time, making it less adaptable.\n",
        "\n",
        "**3. Code Reusability:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- Composition allows you to **reuse components in different contexts** without creating a rigid class hierarchy.\n",
        "- This can lead to more modular and reusable code, as components can be easily plugged into different objects.\n",
        "- Inheritance can sometimes limit reusability, as classes are tied to a specific hierarchy.\n",
        "\n",
        "**4. Avoiding the \"Liskov Substitution Principle\" Violation:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- The Liskov Substitution Principle states that objects of a subclass should be substitutable for objects of their superclass without altering the program's correctness.\n",
        "- Inheritance can sometimes lead to violations of this principle, causing unexpected behavior.\n",
        "- Composition is less prone to these violations, as it doesn't create a strict \"is-a\" relationship.\n",
        "\n",
        "**5. Easier Testing:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- Classes that use composition are often easier to test in isolation, as their dependencies can be mocked or replaced with test doubles.\n",
        "- Inheritance can make testing more challenging, as it can be difficult to isolate a subclass from its parent class's behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "**6. Better Mapping to Real-World Relationships:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- Composition often mirrors real-world relationships more accurately than inheritance.\n",
        "- For example, a car \"has-an\" engine, not \"is-an\" engine.\n",
        "- Modeling these relationships with composition can lead to more intuitive and understandable code.\n",
        "\n",
        "**In summary, composition often leads to more flexible, reusable, and maintainable code in Python. While inheritance has its place, composition is generally preferred for its benefits in creating loosely coupled and adaptable systems.**"

It's a fundamental principle in object-oriented programming where one class contains an instance of another class as one of its attributes, representing a composition relationship. This relationship aids in designing software systems by allowing complex objects to be constructed from simpler parts or components.\n",

        "**1. Increased Complexity:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- Large systems built with numerous composed objects can become complex, making it difficult to understand the overall structure and relationships between components.\n",
        "- Debugging and tracing issues can be challenging due to the distributed nature of functionality across multiple objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. Tight Coupling:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- While composition often promotes loose coupling, some designs can unintentionally create tight coupling between objects.\n",
        "- Objects might become overly dependent on specific details of their composed components, making them less adaptable and difficult to modify or reuse independently.\n",
        "\n",
        "**3. Boilerplate Code:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- Implementing composition sometimes requires additional boilerplate code to define methods for interacting with and managing composed objects.\n",
        "- This can increase the initial development time and code size, especially for complex systems with many interacting components.\n",
        "\n",
        "**4. Overuse of Interfaces:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- Overreliance on interfaces to abstract interactions between composed objects can introduce additional complexity and lead to a proliferation of classes just to provide specific access methods.\n",
        "- Finding the right balance between abstraction and concrete implementation is crucial.\n",
        "\n",
        "**5. Testability:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- Testing classes with complex composition can be challenging. You might need to mock or isolate individual components to effectively test the functionality of the whole system.\n",
        "\n",
        "**6. Potential for Circular Dependencies:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- In intricate object networks, circular dependencies can arise where two objects depend on each other's functionality.\n",
        "- These dependencies can be difficult to manage and can lead to runtime errors if not carefully planned and avoided.\n",
        "\n",
        "**To mitigate these challenges, consider these recommendations:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Start small and favor simplicity:** Avoid unnecessarily complex compositions and build your system incrementally to maintain understanding.\n",
        "- **Use clear design patterns:** Employ established design patterns like Dependency Injection to promote loose coupling and manage dependencies effectively.\n",
        "- **Focus on interfaces for abstraction:** Define clear interfaces for interactions between components while avoiding excessive over-abstraction.\n",
        "- **Prioritize modularity and isolation:** Aim for component independence and testability to simplify maintenance and testing.\n",
        "- **Document your design:** Maintain clear documentation to explain the relationships and responsibilities within your composed system.\n",

        "\n",
        "3. **Flexibility**: Composition allows us to create flexible code that can be easily modified or extended. By composing objects from other objects, we can create loosely coupled components that can be easily modified or replaced without affecting the entire codebase.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Abstraction**: Composition allows us to create abstract interfaces that hide the details of composed objects from outside the class. This helps to maintain abstraction and prevent accidental modification of data.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Encapsulation**: Composition allows us to encapsulate and hide the details of composed objects in classes. Access modifiers can be used to control the visibility of class members and hide the details of composed objects from outside the class. This helps to maintain abstraction and prevent accidental modification of data.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, composition is a powerful technique for creating complex objects by combining simpler objects together. Composition enhances code maintainability and modularity in Python programs by promoting code reuse, modularity, flexibility, abstraction, and encapsulation.\n",

        "**1. Dependency Injection:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Definition:** Objects are provided with their dependencies (other objects they need) from external sources, rather than creating them internally.\n",
        "- **Benefits:**\n",
        "    - Loose coupling between objects, promoting flexibility and testability.\n",
        "    - Easy to swap different implementations of dependencies at runtime.\n",
        "    - Facilitates configuration and testing by injecting mock objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. Strategy Pattern:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Definition:** Encapsulates algorithms or behaviors within interchangeable objects, allowing the selection of a specific strategy at runtime.\n",
        "- **Benefits:**\n",
        "    - Separates behavior from the context in which it's used, promoting reusability and flexibility.\n",
        "    - Changes in behavior can be made without modifying client code.\n",
        "    - Enables dynamic switching of algorithms or policies.\n",
        "\n",
        "**3. Decorator Pattern:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Definition:** Dynamically adds or modifies behavior of an object by wrapping it in a decorator object.\n",
        "- **Benefits:**\n",
        "    - Extends functionality without altering original object's structure.\n",
        "    - Multiple decorators can be stacked to compose behaviors.\n",
        "\n",
        "**4. Reflection (Language-Specific):**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Definition:** Inspects or modifies the structure and behavior of objects at runtime.\n",
        "- **Benefits:**\n",
        "    - Powerful for dynamic object manipulation and metaprogramming.\n",
        "    - Can be used to change properties, invoke methods, or create new objects at runtime.\n",
        "\n",
        "**5. Proxy Pattern:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Definition:** Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object, controlling access to it.\n",
        "- **Benefits:**\n",
        "    - Can intercept calls to the original object, enabling dynamic behavior changes or additional logic.\n",
        "    - Useful for lazy loading, access control, or logging.\n",
        "\n",
        "**6. Interceptors/Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP):**\n",

        "- **Definition:** Intercepts calls to objects, allowing for cross-cutting concerns to be addressed transparently.\n",
        "- **Benefits:**\n",
        "    - Separates concerns like logging, security, or transaction management from core business logic.\n",
        "    - Can dynamically weave behavior into objects at runtime.\n",

        "**Choice of technique depends on:**\n",
